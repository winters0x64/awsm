# Infos (Only write what's not on the official documentation and which is relevant to this system)

* For splitting the default rc.lua config file i'm gonna follow this repo [here](https://github.com/suconakh/awesome-awesome-rc).
    * rc.lua    - would combine all the modularized code.
    * bindings  - would have bindings for global and client keys and mouse bindings.
    * config    - variables for apps and tags.
    * modules   - third party libs
    * rules     - client rules
    * signals   - callback functions on recieving specific signals
    * widgets   - home to all widgets
