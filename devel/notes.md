## General

One question that might come to the mind of someone seeing this would be why reinvent the wheel, there are already plenty of desktops available why make a new one?, to a fair amount the question actually makes a lot of sense the reason why i'm doing it is i do it mainly in my free time also i like making stuff like this it makes me happy :) , but thats about me lets talk about a wide audience, now if you are seeing then you are most prolly a computer person either a student or a professional, either ways one of the main issues that us computer guys face is stress which could be due to a lot of factors mostly becuase of sitting in front of a computer for long hours, our field requires the most less amount of physical movement amongst all other fields so it's important for us to take care of our mental,physical health and also at the same time being productive, this is why i'm making this as the exisitng systems that i've tried all failed to satisfy me in these terms so this project would check off all the featurs needed to satisfy the terms mentioned.

## Awesome

* For splitting the default rc.lua config file i'm gonna follow this repo [here](https://github.com/suconakh/awesome-awesome-rc).
    * rc.lua    - would combine all the modularized code.
    * bindings  - would have bindings for global and client keys and mouse bindings.
    * config    - variables for apps and tags.
    * modules   - third party libs eg bling
    * rules     - client rules
    * signals   - callback functions on recieving specific signals
    * widgets   - home to all widgets
