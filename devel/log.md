# Logs of what i'm doing, along with the reasons (Actions should always align with desgin goals)

-> Added support for touchpad tap to click via libinput.
-> Added JetBrains Mono  as a font for alacritty,simple because it looks elegant.
-> Installed btop, because i would obviously need a system monitor and btop just works fine and is minimal.
-> Installed blueberry, coz it's minimal,usable and blueman was giving out weird errors.
-> Organized rc.lua found a standard that works with the dot reference but now have to learn how all things works.
